* A simple client server app in Java.
the current development is in the branch 'alternative'


** Concepts
- The client's data is not stored in server.

** The problems
1. Add error handling wrapper
2. Add quit option
3. Requires robust testing 
4. Possibly the concurrency is not perfect 
5. Possibly client's presenter is not very elegant solution 
6. Project structure sucks!
