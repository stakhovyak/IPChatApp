* About the app
A simple client server app in Java.

** Concepts
- The client's data is not stored in server.

** The problems
1. Add error handling wrapper
2. Add quit option
3. ClientConnectionHandler receives the messages but can't display them in ChatWindow.
4. Refactor the connection handlers to extend one class
5. The app's architecture looks like MVC, but there is no Model!

** Possible solutions
The third issue could be solved by implementing Observer and updating the ChatWindow.
